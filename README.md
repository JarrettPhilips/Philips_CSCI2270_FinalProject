### Project Summary
A simple Blackjack dealer. 

The game is the standard version of blackjack, involving a dealer (run by the program), and 1+ players. The game can also be run with any number of decks desired. The game follows the common rules of blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer's hand while not going over 21 points in value. Currently, Ace's are always considered 11 points.

### Running
1. Navigate to folder containing source files in terminal
2. Compile source with "g++ Main.cpp Game.cpp"
3. To execute, run "./a.out"
4. The program will lead you through the final steps of setting up a game to your liking

### System Requirements
